This product is lackluster to say the least and the support is worse. There is no accountability for the flaws of the system or the issues we've had migrating. In fact, Felicite was quick to inform me this isn't a chirotouch problem, it's a me problem. I'm certain we won't be staying with the cloud version, or the server based we had prior.

You are practice management software, helping thousands of practices across the country, we expect someone to understand reports and be able to help us with questions. This CT Cloud, doesn't even have a spot for cost data on inventory items. We are constantly looking in Classic version to compare cost data and be able to update the Cloud with sales prices. And we keep Classic running on a separate screen on our front desk so we can see how claims are processing vs the new system, and can see what's typically owed by a patient since there have been so many issues with allowed amounts, deductibles and allocations.
